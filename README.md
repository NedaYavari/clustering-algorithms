This project investigates the performance of four widely-used clustering algorithms – K-means, DBSCAN, Agglomerative Clustering, and Spectral Clustering – across a diverse range of eight medical datasets, encompassing a variety of medical conditions, including stroke prediction, hepatitis C, body fat prediction, cirrhosis prediction, heart failure prediction, lung cancer prediction, thyroid cancer recurrence, and schizophrenia and aphasia. The research aimed to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm in handling different medical datasets, providing valuable insights into their suitability for various medical applications.


A primary focus was to develop a robust and adaptable code framework that can be generalized and applied to a wider range of medical datasets beyond those specifically investigated here. This framework incorporates essential data preprocessing techniques, including methods for handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and applying dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA. Hyperparameter tuning strategies are also implemented to optimize the performance of each algorithm on specific datasets.
