This project investigates the performance of four widely-used clustering algorithms – K-means, DBSCAN, Agglomerative Clustering, and Spectral Clustering – across a diverse range of eight medical datasets, encompassing a variety of medical conditions, including stroke prediction, hepatitis C, body fat prediction, cirrhosis prediction, heart failure prediction, lung cancer prediction, thyroid cancer recurrence, and schizophrenia and aphasia. The research aimed to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm in handling different medical datasets, providing valuable insights into their suitability for various medical applications.
